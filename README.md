## Project Goal <a name="goal"/>

For this project, I tried to see whether the low-income class has a higher preventable emergency visits rate.

## Data Source <a name="source"/>

There are two kinds of datasets. One is a **potentially preventable emergency visit rates** that includes a list of PPV rates for each county in NY states. The other is a **income tax** that includes income class, number of returns for each county in NY states.

  - [All-Payer Potentially Preventable Emergency Visit (PPV) Rates by Patient County](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/All-Payer-Potentially-Preventable-Emergency-Visit-/f8ue-xzy3)
  - [Medicaid Potentially Preventable Emergency Visit (PPV) Rates by Patient County](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Medicaid-Potentially-Preventable-Emergency-Visit-P/cr7a-34ka)
- **Income Tax**

## Summary

The lower income people are more likely to put off getting care until it is too late to avoid: over 90% county of New York States has higher PPV rate among Medicaid patients than average.
